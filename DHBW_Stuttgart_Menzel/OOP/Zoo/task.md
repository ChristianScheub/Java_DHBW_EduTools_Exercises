    <h1>Feeding Animals Task</h1>
    <p>You've been tasked with simulating the feeding of animals in a zoo. This task involves creating several classes in Java to manage the zoo's operations effectively.</p>
    <h2>Classes:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Feeder:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This class is responsible for managing the daily operations in the zoo.</li>
                <li>It has methods to simulate a day in the zoo, feed animals, and manage their population.</li>
                <li>Hint: Look for methods related to simulating days, feeding animals, and managing animal populations.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Animal:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This is an abstract class representing various animals in the zoo.</li>
                <li>It contains an abstract method that subclasses need to implement for feeding.</li>
                <li>Hint: Focus on understanding the abstract nature of this class and its method related to feeding.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Food:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Represents the different types of food available in the zoo.</li>
                <li>Contains information about the quantity of each type of food.</li>
                <li>Hint: Pay attention to the attributes and methods related to managing food quantities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Lion:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A subclass of Animal representing lions in the zoo.</li>
                <li>Implements the feed() method to handle feeding lions with specific types of food.</li>
                <li>Hint: Explore the feed() method to understand how lions are fed and what types of food they consume.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Penguin:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Another subclass of Animal representing penguins in the zoo.</li>
                <li>Implements the feed() method to handle feeding penguins with specific types of food.</li>
                <li>Hint: Similar to Lion, check the feed() method to understand how penguins are fed and what types of food they consume.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Task Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Implement feed() Method:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement the feed() method in the Lion and Penguin subclasses to ensure they can be fed properly based on the available food.</li>
                <li>Hint: Focus on how different types of food are consumed by lions and penguins.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Simulate Day:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement the simulateDay() method in the Feeder class to simulate feeding animals for a day.</li>
                <li>Hint: Look for methods to manage the flow of a day in the zoo, including feeding animals and handling any events that may occur.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Manage Food Quantities and Animal Population:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure proper handling of food quantities to prevent animals from going hungry.</li>
                <li>Manage the population of animals in the zoo appropriately.</li>
                <li>Hint: Check for methods related to updating food quantities and managing animal populations based on feeding and other events.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
